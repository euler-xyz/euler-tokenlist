# Euler Tokenlist

A simple single script to generate tokens which have a WETH pair available on Uniswap V3.
The tokens under consideration are based on Coingecko (https://tokenlists.org/token-list?url=https://tokens.coingecko.com/uniswap/all.json).

Includes an Automated pipeline setup for running and commiting changes every 24 hours, to reflect newly added pairs.
